## Available demos
For now, these are the available demos in this repository. New demos are welcome, in particular if tested with real hardware.
Some other manipulators that couldd be added to this list is the ![Open Manipulator](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/open_manipulator) or other dual setups.

| Robots | Franka Robotics FR3 | FR Dual FR3 | IIWA 14 | Kinova Gen3 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| MuJoCo simulated Hardware | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Real Hardware | ✅ | ✅ | ❔[^1]  | ❔[^1] |

[^1]: Untested, but effort interface available.

## Running a demo


1. (TEMPORARY) Clone the crisp controllers to the repo (later it will be part of the Dockerfile)
```bash
git clone git@github.com:utiasDSL/crisp_controllers_demos.git crisp_controllers_demos
cd crisp_controllers_demos
git clone git@github.com:utiasDSL/crisp_controllers.git crisp_controllers
```

!!! WARNING
    Do NOT use **Docker Desktop**. Just go for the normal Docker CLI.

2. Build and start the provided container.
```bash
docker compose build
```
3. Start your robot:
```bash
docker compose up launch_iiwa
```
or
```bash
LEFT_ROBOT_IP=172.16.1.2 \
RIGHT_ROBOT_IP=172.16.0.2 \
FRANKA_FAKE_HARDWARE=true \
docker compose up launch_dual_franka
```
or
```bash
ROBOT_IP=172.16.0.2 \
FRANKA_FAKE_HARDWARE=true\
docker compose up launch_franka
```
or
```bash
docker compose up launch_kinova
```

4. Now you can publish to `/target_joint`, `/target_wrench` or `/target_pose`! Check [crisp_py](https://github.com/utiasDSL/crisp_py) examples to see how to easily use it.

!!! WARNING
    If you work in different machines (using [crisp_py](https://github.com/utiasDSL/crisp_py) or others) you might want to consider using a different RMW.
    Check [how to multi-machine setup](multi_machine_setup.md).
    To use the cyclone version you can call `launch_franka_cyclone` or `launch_dual_franka_cyclone` and setup the ip address of the router of your machine in the setup file.

## Troubleshooting

??? "Rviz does not open when launch the robots. Why?"
    Simply run `xhost +` on a terminal to enable any host to use the X. You need this because we are running the demos in a container.

??? "When executing `ros2 topic list` in a different terminal, I can not see any topics. However, the container is running. Why?"
    Probably you are using a different `ROS_DOMAIN_ID`. The default now is set to 100 but you can change it when running the container. To change it in your shell run `export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=100 && ros2 daemon stop && ros2 daemon start`.

??? "How are the manipulors being simulated?"
    We implemeted a simple `MujocoHardwareInterface` to simulate the robots. This code is heavily inspired by the simulator in <a href="https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/cartesian_controllers/tree/ros2/cartesian_controller_simulation">cartesian_controllers</a>, but probably better alternatives to use mujoco as a backend simulation would be <a href="https://github.com/moveit/mujoco_ros2_control">mujoco_ros2_control</a>. One could also use gazebo. 
    The mujoco files come from the mujoco menagerie and have been slightly modified to use torque based actuators + we added some friction to the joints (to increase realism).
